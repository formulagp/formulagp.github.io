title: Jay Authement's ePortfolio
description: Welcome to my ePortfolio page! This page contains a few of my completed projects at Southern New Hampshire University as well as a code review performed on all three artifacts. Each project was created and later enhanced to show my proficiency in three major software development categories, software design/engineering, algorithm design/structures, and database design. Feel free to browse around and take a look at my included projects!
