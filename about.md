# About me!

My name is Jay Authement and I live in New Orleans, Louisiana. I am currently finishing my Computer Science degree with a concentration in Software Engineering
here at Southern New Hampshire University.

### Work History

After receiving my Associateof Applied Science in Industrial Technology in May 2010, I immediately received a job offer in the oil and gas industry, where I currently still work. Today, my title is Lead Operator at the Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery. In this position I work a distributed controls system (DCS) where I monitor and control plant process variables, among other smaller job tasks.

### Future Aspirations

My passion has always been working with computers and learning as much as I can about how they function from a techincal standpoint. My reason for going back to school for my Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science is simple enough. I wish to one day switch careers with the hope of working in the software industry and help design the software and programs that will have positive impacts on the world.
