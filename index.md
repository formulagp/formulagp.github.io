# Code Review
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vrjaMnJcEUM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrjaMnJcEUM&t=1 "Code Review")

The video above is a code review, performed by me on three seperate projects that were completed throughout my courses at SNHU. The result of the code review has led to enhancing these projects, which is linked here on the site!

# Pi Weather Station

This first project is the Pi Weather Station created with a Raspberry Pi 4 computer and a GrovePi hardware kit from Dexter Industries. It's purpose is to continuously collect temperature and humidity data from a sensor and output all the gathered data to a JSON file once the program is stopped. There are LED's connected as well that can show the user exactly what conditions are being read from the sensors and will even shutdown at night, once the light sensor no longer detects sunlight. Below is a link to the GitHub repository that contains everything needed to get the program running!

# Upgraded Vector Sorting

The second project presented here is a program that was created to show a comprehension of some commonly used algorithms in the computer science industry. Using a provided CSV file, a vector is created that stores all the data it contains in an unsorted fashion. Using the menu created, the user will have the options to first load the CSV file into a vector, then perform whichever sort function this wish to use. In this program the algorithms available for use are the selection sort, the upgraded selection sort, or the quick sort function. Each will display the time it takes to successfully sort the data after running. To verify the sorts were completed successfully, the user then has the ability to choose display bids again and see that the elements are now sorted. A link to the GitHub repository is below!
