# Code Review
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vrjaMnJcEUM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrjaMnJcEUM&t=1 "Code Review")

The video above is a code review, performed by me on three seperate projects that were completed throughout my courses at SNHU. The result of the code review has led to enhancing these projects, which is linked here on the site!

# Pi Weather Station
### Software Design and Engineering

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pi Weather Station project is a weather monitoring program created with a Raspberry Pi 4 computer, the Python programming language, and a GrovePi hardware kit purchased from Dexter Industries. It's purpose is to continuously collect temperature and humidity data from a sensor and output all the gathered information to a JSON file once the program is stopped. There are LED's connected as well that show the user exactly what the weather conditions are based on what colors are illuminated at the time. The Pi Weather Station will even shutdown at night, once the attached light sensor no longer detects sunlight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an opportunity to showcase my skills and abilities in software design, the program has since been enhanced and upgraded to version [1.1.0]. Two new features have been added in the form of new Python functions that give the machine a startup and shutdown sequence. When the Pi Weather Station is booted up, a startup sequence runs which now displays a welcome message to the user and flashes the green LED two times, indicating it is in startup mode. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a link to the GitHub repository that contains the newly enhanced program along with the original for comparison.

# Upgraded Vector Sorting

The second project presented here is a program that was created to show a comprehension of some commonly used algorithms in the computer science industry. Using a provided CSV file, a vector is created that stores all the data it contains in an unsorted fashion. Using the menu created, the user will have the options to first load the CSV file into a vector, then perform whichever sort function this wish to use. In this program the algorithms available for use are the selection sort, the upgraded selection sort, or the quick sort function. Each will display the time it takes to successfully sort the data after running. To verify the sorts were completed successfully, the user then has the ability to choose display bids again and see that the elements are now sorted. A link to the GitHub repository is below!

# MongoDB Database

Finally, the MongoDB Database project shown above presents an excellent opportunity to display my skills working with databases. This particular project utilizes the NoSQL database program MongoDB along with the Python programming language to perform CRUD operations on provided databases, creating a powerful stack program. The program allows the user to select and connect to one of two databases, which can be imported into MongoDB from the repository link below. Once connected, a second menu allows the user to either create, read, update, or delete data in the current database of their choice. Once finished, the user may disconnect and exit the database, where they are allowed to select another database to connect to. Again, the user is able to perform CRUD operations or disconnect from the database. Once finished, the user may select the exit option to properly shutdown the prgoram. To try the program yourself, please take a look at the project repository linked below!
